## 2026-09-26 — Fixing allocation priority at the data layer, not the cost formula

Resolved by d0c20b4.

Phase 05's plan specified the allocation solver's reward as
`-(1000 - order(T))` per top-level group plus a flat `-10` per inner-group
hop, with `order(T)` the group's array index. Implementing it verbatim and
running the plan's own named test (`a compulsory COMP3630 in THCS stays
compulsory`) failed: my worked calculation showed the deep THCS path
(`-1006`) beats `compulsory`'s direct path (`-997`), because a single `-10`
inner-hop bonus exceeds the `1`-unit gap between adjacent orders.

The obvious fix — rescale the order step so adjacent orders dominate any
inner-hop total — worked for that case, but broke a second one
(`COMP4550` vs. `comp-upper`): I derived the two needed inequalities
algebraically (`STEP > 10` for the first pairing, `STEP < 5` for the
second) and they're mutually exclusive. No scaling constant satisfies
both simultaneously, for any tuning — a fact only found by writing out
both inequalities side by side, not by trial-and-error on numbers.

The correction that actually held: this isn't an algorithm-tuning problem
at all. `comp-upper`'s generic COMP-3000/4000 filter was accidentally
double-purposing capstone's *project* courses as ordinary electives — a
data-modelling gap, not a solver defect. Excluding those three codes from
`comp-upper`'s filter (`excludeCodes`) fixed it with zero risk to every
other allocation the solver already got right, and is checkable by
running exactly the two named tests plus the full suite, not by re-deriving
the formula. The harness itself now encodes the fix (`allocation.test.ts`
tests both pairings explicitly), so a future change to the group tree
that reintroduces the overlap fails a test immediately instead of silently
misallocating a capstone course.
